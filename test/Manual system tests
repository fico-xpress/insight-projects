        Then only the cards for the 3 projects owned by the user should be shown

    Scenario: all projects are shown when show "all" is selected
            Given there are 3 projects owned by the user and 1 project not owned by the user
            And the filtering is currently set to "own"
            Then only the cards for the 3 projects owned by the user should be shown
            When the user clicks on the "all" option
            Then all 4 cards should be shown
            When the user clicks on the "own" option
            Then only the cards for the 3 projects owned by the user should be shown
